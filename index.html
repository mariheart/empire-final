    <div class="text">The year 1989 saw change in Europe not seen since the end of World War II. The Eastern Bloc, after about 50 years of communist rule, began to crumble. It started with a spark in Poland, which then grew to countries like East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania. Every last country listed, through civil unrest and mass protests, broke apart from the Soviet Union and established democracies. However, Romania stands out from the rest in a particular way. Whereas most of these countries peacefully ended their relationship with their socialist governments, Romania forwent all notions of peace and channeled their 50 years of oppression into violently overthrowing - and executing - their leaders.</div>

    <div class="text">Over the past decades, the media has grown to be one of the most powerful tools in modern military and governments. As we discover the intricacies of this fairly new revolution, we realize that television has played a massive role during the Romanian Revolution. For the first time, individuals were able to view a revolution in its entirety as it was broadcasted in real time across the globe. Based on a collaboration of documents of the Romanian secret services, former television employees, and audiovisual material, we’re able to watch the Romanian Revolution through a lense we have not been able to view previous revolutions from before. The power television had on overthrowing Nicolae Ceaușescu is the catalyst of the decade-long power struggle between Ceaușescu and the spectators. The televising of the revolution acts as the central acts in transforming Communist regime into a new era and then depicting them as a form of new democratic guidance.

    <div class="text">Pavel Campeanu, a sociologist, argued that in Romania, a new revolutionary subject had emerged in 1989–– the TV audience. The telerevolution operated via electronic networks of communication which ranged from radio to telephone spreading quickly across regions. Television truly took agency during this revolution and properly understanding this concept is a proper way to acknowledge the role this medium played within the popular movement.
    </div>
    <div class="text">Interpretations of the Romanian Revolution within visual media have expanded in three different directions. Firstly, liberal media have spoken of “the stolen revolution” highlighting the new political power that rose from the effects of the revolution. Next, supporters of nationalism grounded in communist ideologies identify a “false revolution” operated by strict foreign services. Finally, sympathizers of the new power argue the case of the “spontaneous revolution scenario”. All of these were soon formed once the revolution began its debut in the media.
    </div>
    <div class="text">The spark of the live footage in the Romanian Revolution began from a failed live broadcast of Nicolae Ceaușescu, the communist official who was the leader of Romania from 1965-1989. Initially, he trended liberal by easing censorship and denouncing the soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia but later in 1971, he shifted back, mimicking Chinese communism by issuing “July Thesis” and forcing “Socialist Humanism”. His major media debut began when there were anti-regime protests in the city of Timișoara and rumors of this event had circled back to Radio Free Europe, a foreign broadcaster. Ceaușescu made the decision to address the situation by making a nationwide speech on live TV. He commanded a mass rally directly in front of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party which lasted for about an hour. Ceaușescu spoke about the social disruption in Timișoara claiming it as fascist and terrorist as well as announcing a mass rally to then take place the day following.

    <div class="text">The power of the television in 1989 manifested itself through the events of the Revolution. It became an outlet for the audience's dissent towards Ceaușescu throughout the final decade of his regime. In the past, as live television was a way to make leaders vulnerable in the ways it was able to create criticism against them, strict measures of control were set up as ways to prevent anti-regime incidents from happening in real time on air. These measures were created to protect the reputation of Ceaușescu, party officials, and state events. This counters the failed outcome of Ceaușescu’s television appearance as it created massive tension between his rule and the Romanian people.
    </div>
    <div class="text">Even though the impact of different forms of media involvement in revolutions has been recognized for centuries, we see with the case of the Romanian television in 1989 shows that the agency of television skyrocketed far beyond what we have seen in the past. Television does not only provide a thorough understanding of revolutionary events, but it also shows the broader social and historical processes that construct the relationship between what is broadcasted and the viewers reaction. Today and during these events in the late 20th century, television became so naturalised that it was an integral part of everyone's daily social life. The live televising of the Romanian Revolution was a key representation of a great impact on political change in Romania and nations to follow. With this, it is fair to say that the media was a major agency behind the stolen revolution in Romania.

    <div class="text">One can say that Ceaușescu’s last speech was, in a way, a prototype for what was to come decades later, with the ongoing Black Lives Matter movement in the 2010s. Sarah J. Jackson & Brooke Foucault Welles’ “Hijacking #myNYPD: Social Media Dissent and Networked Counterpublics” talks of, of course, hijacking government-sanctioned media and weaponizing it as a tool for protest. They write, “the success of activist organizations and social movements is inherently linked to masses of people, from multiple networks, sharing a sense of outrage. Furthermore, outrage is one of the only forms of citizen affect that mainstream media rewards with attention” (Jackson and Welles, 943)¹. Clearly, Ceaușescu’s speech did not go well with his audience, who were forced to attend to make it seem like the people were on his side. What better way to show that than by hijacking his speech, which was televised, which was one of the only ways Romanians got their daily news. Thanks to the fact that the media was controlled by the state, and they seemingly did not see the hijacking coming, Romanians across the country saw, even if it was not obvious at first, that something was wrong. As such, in Jackson and Welles’ eyes, the Timișoara uprising had succeeded, because it used the one major tool of the regime - media - and used it to televise the brewing revolution that eventually overthrew the Ceaușescus.</div>
    <div class="text">The Romanian Revolution saw many weapons utilized by both the government and the people. However, the ultimate weapon that belonged to the state was pried out and given to the people, and this weapon is television. As a state-controlled entity, Romanian media could only show what the government wanted Romanians to see. After Nicolae Ceaușescu’s final speech in Bucharest, the media was forced to show what Romania truly was: a brewing pot about to spill over. And spill over it did. The revolution was televised for both the Romanian people to see and for history to document what happened in both Timișoara and Bucharest. In a few days, the reign of the Ceaușescus fell, and Romania entered a new era. Romania has indeed awakened.</div>
